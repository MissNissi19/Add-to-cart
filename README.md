Add to cart


Add to Cart is a non-native JavaScript application that allows users to create and manage shopping lists. The application, designed to be accessible across multiple devices, provides a seamless shopping experience. Built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, "Add to Cart" simplifies the process of creating and organizing shopping lists, making it convenient for users to keep track of their purchases.
The application has the ability to add, remove, and edit items in the shopping list dynamically.
This is a project developed as part of my coursework on the Scrimba platform.

You will need a web server to run this to go around CORS limitations.

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
